# memory-game-unity
This is a 2D memory game where you need to match 2 game cards at a time to gain points.

You can find a demo of this game here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkFsNolRb-I
There are 3 modes to this game: easy, medium and hard.
A user can click on a card and reveal the face of it. There can be only two cards face up and not matched at a time. If a pair was not made, then after two seconds the cards will turn with the face down. 
Once a pair has been made, then they will remain with their face up.
Also the user has a functionality of "reset". Pressing it reshuffles the cards.
